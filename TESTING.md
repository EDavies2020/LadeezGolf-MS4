* 2 missing semi colons added - Resolved


# Errors/Warnings PEP8 <a name="pep8"></a>


PEP8 showed a number of errors with length, white space and indentation. 

These have all been resolved.

I had an issue when resolving PEP8 issues which meant that making lines shorter broke my webpage. 

I contacted tutor support and Sean helped me resolve the issue, this did mean some of my code isnt pep8 compliant in terms of length which I understood from Sean is okay:
