This powerful, fairway wood features a carbon composite crown, combined with Jailbreak Technology and Hyper Speed Face Cup for the first time, to promote high ball speed and even more distance. The Rogue Fairway Wood Features: Jailbreak Technology & Hyper Speed Face Cup, Triaxial Carbon Crown, Boeing Aero Package, 2-Year Guarantee & Aldila Synergy Graphite Shaft / Golf Pride New Decade Grip, Distance Technology. Jailbreak Technology places two ultra-light, strong titanium bars behind the clubface, parallel to each other and connected on either end to the crown and sole. The size, strength and location of each Jailbreak bar along with the Hyper Speed Face Cup work together to reduce how much the crown and sole deflect, forcing the face to take on more of the load created at impact than ever before. This results in faster ball speeds across the entire face from swing to swing, promoting more distance. Triaxial Carbon Crown: This light and strong carbon composite surface area redistributes weight to increase the MOI, and minimise spin. This gives more forgiveness on off-centre hits, provides high launch and strong, straight ball flight. Boeing Aero Package: For even more performance the head has been developed by Boeing, with advanced aerodynamics and speed step for better airflow, this further increases clubhead speed for even more distance. Aldila Synergy Graphite Shaft: The ALDILA® SYNERGY® Series – based on one of our most successful profiles ever developed with one major difference.

The SIM2 Driver Features: FORGED RING CONSTRUCTION / SIM INERTIA GENERATOR, SPEED INJECTED™ TWIST FACE™, SPLIT MASS WEIGHTING / THRU-SLOT SPEED POCKET, 2-Year Guarantee / Stock Shaft Option / Golf Pride Z-Grip. TaylorMade has engineered the SIM2 with a new construction that unlocks a new dimension in distance and forgiveness. The new head design features a full carbon sole and crown, and lightweight and high-strength aluminium that is milled precisely to shape. With a massive rear weight and new milled back cup face. This new design provides increased forgiveness and stability giving the golfer more confidence to make the shot. The asymmetric Inertia Generator was designed using advanced geometry and aerodynamic analytics to provide even faster clubhead speed. This along with the full lightweight carbon sole enables the redistribution of mass for a deeper centre of gravity position to enhance forgiveness. This is a revolutionary new face curvature with a corrective face angle on off-centre hits, engineered to reduce side spin and deliver straighter shots. Twist Face provides more loft in the high-toe and less loft in the low-heel to produce more consistent spin where golfers commonly mis-hit. This makes it much easier to produce straighter shots with more confidence. The face is strategically injected with a tuning resin which optimises the COR along the entire area of the face. This injection process achieves the best possible speed performance with the tightest possible tolerance to the legal limit of speed. The new driver also features TaylorMade`s most flexible SPEED POCKET. Engineered to maximise forgiveness and provide additional ball speed on miss-hit low strikes off the face. It also has been designed with SPLIT MASS WEIGHTING to enhance forgiveness while allowing for pinpoint target swing weights during custom assembly. The driver features an adjustable loft sleeve which provides loft change and face angle preferences. Allowing you to dial in your prefered ball flight trajectory or to adapt to different course conditions.
